# This is the lab notebook for Xue's senior thesis in the Evans lab.

The project aims to quantify the effect of genome duplication on transcriptome assembly.  We will use transcriptome data from liver tissue from two frogs: *Xenopus laevis* and *X. tropicalis*.

*Xenopus laevis* is a tetraploid speces with 36 chromosomes. *Xenopus tropicalis* is a diploid species with 20 chromosomes.  Both are African clawed frogs.
