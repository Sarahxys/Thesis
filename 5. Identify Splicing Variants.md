#Identify Splice Variants
#Conversation Summary
Summary from Jan 9 and 30 2017 discussion between Dr Ben Evans and Xue Song regarding identification of splice variants.
- goal: identify total exons, max exons per transcript, min exons per transcript, location of variants(ends or middle)
- method: 
  - firstly, run Blast with set of assembled transcripts flagged with "no error" or "contain scaffold" against itself. 
  - Then used the Blast result and coordinate information from previous genomic blast to achieve goal
- critiria
  - transcripts that are just repeat region of each other does not count as splicing vairants. 
  - transcripts that identified as splicing variants should have genomic coordinate close to each other
  - transcripts that identified as splicing variants have to hae two exons mapped to each other or have one large mapped exon that is greater than 200bp(changable variable). 
  
  
#Blastn with Error-free transcripts
Command for running blastn with db and error-free transcripts
```
blastn -task blastn -db /home/xue/genome_data/db_Xlaevis_v91 -outfmt 6 -evalue 0.00005 -query /home/xue/transcriptome_data/blastn_BJE4168_output/4168_ErrorFreeList -out /home/xue/transcriptome_data/ExtractTranscriptome/blastout_4168; gzip /home/xue/transcriptome_data/ExtractTranscriptome/blastout_4168; echo "blastn of 4168 extractedtranscriptome started 0:54 Feb 27 2017"|mail sarahsongxy@gmail.com
