# Most Recent Analysis Summary Per gene:
Trinity output isoforms for some genes. Results here were summarized the error rate of assembled transcriptome per gene. 
  - If all the isoforms of a gene were flagged as "no error", the gene would be flagged as "No error".
  - If some of the isoforms of a gene were flagged as "no error" and others were flagged as problematic, the gene would be flagged as having "Some error";
  - If all the isoforms of a gene were flagged as problemtic, the gene would be flagged as "Error".
