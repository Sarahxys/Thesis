# Basics for Unix

If you want to cancel a command type `Command .`

If you want to view the contents of a directory type `ls`.

If you want to change a directory type `cd `\<directory path\>.

If you want to know what directory you are in type `pwd`.

If you want to make a directory, type `mkdir` \<directory name\>.

If you want to remove a file type `rm -f `\<filename\>; to remove a directory `rm -rf`\<filename\>.

# Installing trinity
To download the trinity package we typed `wget https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/archive/v2.2.0.tar.gz`.  This link would have to be updated when an new version becomes available.

To uncompress it, type `tar -zxvf v2.2.0.tar.gz`

Instructions for install are her `https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki/Installing%20Trinity`.

# Installing trimmomatic

This software is used to trim off bad sequences based on position in the read and quality scores of the nucleotides.  You can get it like this `wget http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/Trimmomatic-0.36.zip`

Uncompress it like this:
`unzip Trimmomatic-0.36.zip`

And run trimmomatic like this 

`java -jar /home/xue/Trimmomatic-0.36/trimmomatic-0.36.jar PE -phred33 -trimlog trim_out.txt /home/xue/transcriptome_data/Sample_BenEvansBJE3909cDNA_Library/BenEvansBJE3909cDNA_Library_GTGAAA_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz /home/xue/transcriptome_data/Sample_BenEvansBJE3909cDNA_Library/BenEvansBJE3909cDNA_Library_GTGAAA_L004_R2_001.fastq.gz /home/xue/transcriptome_data/BJE3909_tropicalis_trimmed_data/BenEvansBJE3909cDNA_Library_GTGAAA_L004_R1_001_paired.fastq.gz /home/xue/transcriptome_data/BJE3909_tropicalis_trimmed_data/BenEvansBJE3909cDNA_Library_GTGAAA_L004_R1_001_single.fastq.gz /home/xue/transcriptome_data/BJE3909_tropicalis_trimmed_data/BenEvansBJE3909cDNA_Library_GTGAAA_L004_R2_001_paired.fastq.gz /home/xue/transcriptome_data/BJE3909_tropicalis_trimmed_data/BenEvansBJE3909cDNA_Library_GTGAAA_L004_R2_001_single.fastq.gz ILLUMINACLIP:/home/xue/Trimmomatic-0.36/adapters/TruSeq2-PE.fa:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36`



# Basics for using info.

To connect to info, use this command:

`ssh xue@info.mcmaster.ca`

This gets you into the `head` server, which is called infoserv.  Please do not run jobs on the head.  Instead you can connect to the other processors like this: `rsh info115` (or `rsh info113`, `rsh info114`,...).

You can check how busy a system is using the unix command `top`.  Exit by typing `q`.

# Using Unix Screen

Screen is very useful for running background jobs.

To launch a screen session type `screen -S `\<session name\>.

To exit a screen type `control a, d`.  

To list screen type `screen -ls`.

To reconnect with a screen type `screen -r `\<session name\>.

To kill a screen type `screen -X -S ` \<session name\> ` kill`.

To exit the server type `logout`.

# The data

Once the data were copied over, we uncompressed each file like this:

`tar -xvf Sample_BenEvansBJE3909cDNA_Library.tar`
and
`tar -xvf Sample_BenEvansBJE4168cDNA_Library.tar`

# To empty space in head 1 server, move it and zip it 
To know how large the file is:
 ```
 du -sh *
 ```
To move it to head 4:
```
mv trinityrnaseq-2.2.0/ /4/xue/
```
To create a symbolic link:
```
ln -s /4/xue/trinityrnaseq-2.2.0/ hereistrin
```
To move it back to head 1 from head 4:
```
mv /4/xue/trinityrnaseq-2.2.0/ .
```
To zip files:
```
gzip filename
```
To zip directory: 
```
tar -cvf genome_data.tar genome_data
```
# Sent notice when job is done from the server
```
SOME COMMAND ; echo "this job is done" | mail your_email@gmail.com
```
