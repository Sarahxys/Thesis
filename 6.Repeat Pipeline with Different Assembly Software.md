# Repeatition with Various Assembly software
We will repeat the pipeline for section 4. assessment metric and 5.identifying alternative splicing variant with the following assemblysoftwares:
- TransAbyss
- SOAPdenovo-Trans

# Compiling TransAbyss
- A directory was created to install TransAbyss locally. All software will be download and install to this directory. The program will be execute from this directory as well. The path is:
```
/home/xue/software
```
- Program requirement for transabyss and transabyss-merge as list below.
