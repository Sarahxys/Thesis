# Repeatition with Various Assembly software
We will repeat the pipeline for section 4. assessment metric and 5.identifying alternative splicing variant with the following assemblysoftwares:
- TransAbyss
- SOAPdenovo-Trans

# Compiling TransAbyss
- A directory was created to install TransAbyss locally. All software will be download and install to this directory. The program will be execute from this directory as well. The path is:
```
/home/xue/software
```
- Program requirement for transabyss and transabyss-merge as list below. 
  - Python 2.7.6+
  - python-igraph 0.7.0+
  - BLAT
  - AbySS 1.5.2
 - BLAT and Python 2.7.6+ are already installed in the info.mcmaster.ca server.
 - To install python-igraph
 ```
 pip install python-igraph --prefix=/home/xue/software
 ```
 - AbySS 1.5.2 require a lot installations see below session for detail. ABySS requires the following libraries:
    - Boost
    - Open MPI
    - sparsehash
    - SQLite
 
 # Installing Abyss
We compiled ABySS from source following instruction on its github wiki page (https://github.com/bcgsc/abyss#quick-start). Required libraries was installed as below:
- Installing Boost
    - Boost was download as:
    ```
    wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.63.0/boost_1_63_0.tar.bz2
    ```
    - It was unzipped as:
    ```
    ```
- Install Open-MRI
    - Open MRI was downloaded as:
    ```
    wget https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v2.1/openmpi-2.1.0.tar.gz
    ```
    - It was installed as:
    ```
    tar xf openmpi-2.1.0.tar.gz
    cd openmpi-2.1.0
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ./configure --prefix=/home/xue/software/openmpi-2.0.2
    make install
    ```
- Install sparsehash
    - sparsehash was downloaded as:
    ```
    ```
    - Installed as
    ```
    ```
- Install Multimarkdown
    - Multimarkdown was downloaded as:
    ```
    ```
    - it was installed as:
    ```
    ```
`


Abyss was configured as in the directory (/home/xue/software). Firstly, we specify the location of the dependencies/libraries:
 ```
 --prefix=/home/xue/software/abyss-1.5.2installdir/  --with-mpi=/home/xue/software/openmpi-2.0.2 CPPFLAGS=-I/home/xue/software/sparsehash-master 
 ```
 ```
 PATH=/home/xue/software/MultiMarkdown-5 :$PATH
 ```
 
 
 Then, we configre Abyss
 ```
 ./configure --prefix = /home/xue/software/abyss-1.5.2installdir/ 
 make
 make install
 ```
To run ABySS, its executable should be found in your ```PATH```. Since I installed AbySS in ```/home/xue/software/abyss-1.5.2installdir/```, add it to the ```PATH```:
```
Path=/home/xue/software/abyss-1.5.2installdir/bin:$PATH
```
